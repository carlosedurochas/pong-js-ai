# pong-js-ai
 This repository contains an implementation of an AI player for the classic game of Pong, built using JavaScript. The AI uses a combination of artificial neural network and reinforcement learning to learn and improve its playstyle over time. The goal of this project was to explore the basics of game AI development and create a fun, challenging opponent for the popular retro game, Pong.
